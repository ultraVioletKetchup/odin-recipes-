                Layer the Ingredients
                Start by spreading a thin layer of tomato sauce at the bottom of a baking dish. Layer with cooked lasagna pasta sheets. Add a layer of ground meat, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat these layers until you've used up your ingredients, typically ending with a layer of cheese on top.

                Bake the Lasagna
                Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at around 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.

                Rest and Serve
                Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes after removing it from the oven. This helps to set and makes it easier to slice into perfect portions. Serve your delicious homemade lasagna with a side of salad or garlic bread.
